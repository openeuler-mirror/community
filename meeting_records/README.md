# Project Community Meeting

**NOTE**
1. This meeting introduction is for the project [community](/), not for the whole openEuler Community. 
2. Chinese is not supposed to provide for this README, as the contributors are from all of the world speaking many different languages. If you would like to provide a Chinese version, feel free to create a *README_cn.md* here.
