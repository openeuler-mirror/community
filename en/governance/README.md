# openEuler Community

Welcome to openEuler community.

## Community Vision

**openEuler builds an innovative platform and a unified and open OS that supports the multi-processor architecture**.

## Coummunication


There are several ways to communicate in openEuler, and please read [Communication](/en/communication/) for details.

## Community Governance

openEuler has the following official organizations:

+ **Committee**: A group of people who are assigned to take care of some topics. Although the community encourages being as open as possible, personal communication is allowed due to the sensitivity of the topics undertaken by this group of people. Such as security committee, financial committee, etc.

+ **SIG**: A persistent and open team focused on **specific domain**. This team achieves specific delivery goals through regular tasks and activities. SIG has an open and transparent process, which follows openEuler's [code of conduct](./../../code-of-conduct_en.md). Anyone can participate and contribute. Find SIGs in <https://openeuler.org/en/sig.html>. 

+ **Sub-projects**: Sub-projects are established within the SIG to achieve **specific delivery goals or results** and can work independently. A subproject has one or more repositories, which are the main output organization of the openEuler community. All sub-projects are in the SIG to which they belong. If the project's deliverables need to enter the community distribution scope, you can submit an application to the technical committee. Please refer to [SIG application guidance](/en/technical-committee/governance/README.md).

+ **The sub-project has two phases: incubation phase and maturity phase**. Software packages for mature projects are available on the community distribution CD. Incubation projects can apply for software packages to enter the community's `/extra` (extra package not included in the CD-ROM) directory or` /experimental` (exploration, experimental package) directory

+ **Working Group**: An ad hoc group set up to resolve issues across SIG borders. The workgroup does not own any code or long-term deliverables. It can be reported through the relevant SIG. One example is the Community Security Coding Working Group.

 More detailed information about these organizations can be found in [Community Governance](/en/governance/). SIG can have its own contribution strategy (described in the "README" or "CONTRIBUTING" file in this SIG/project team's repo), as well as its own mailing list, IRC channel, etc.

If you need more information about SIG/project structure and organization, please refer to [SIG Governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/).



## Contribute

The first step to make a contribution is to choose from [openEuler SIG/Project list](https://openeuler.org/en/sig.html). Start participating in SIG/project meetings, join the IRC channel and subscribe to the mailing list. SIGs/projects usually consist of a series of `help-wanted` ISSUEs that can help new contributors to participate.

The Contribution Guide provides ways to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted, including detailed instructions:

1. How to ask questions

2. How to find what works

3. How to submit a PR
