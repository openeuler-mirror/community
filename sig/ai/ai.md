# Application to create a new SIG
English | [简体中文](./bigdata_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README] (/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance] (/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).
 
# SIG Mission
AI has been applied to many areas of the society and be used in all walks of life to improve productivity. There are many enthusiasts outside the industry and academia. To better support enthusiasts and developers in scientific research institutes and production enterprises to quickly and better practice AI on OpenEuler, It is necessary to build AI-related capabilities.

# Service scope
- Build an AI ecosystem for digital infrastructure and collaborate with chip vendors and third-party AI frameworks to develop the AI industry, including AI+big data/HPC/search convergence.
- Provides built-in AI framework training/inference software to enable openEuler ecosystem partners to quickly explore AI-related technologies based on built-in AI capabilities.
- Build AI-related software maintenance capabilities to ensure the supply security and future evolution.
- Collaborate with communities such as MindSpore and openEuler to jointly contribute to the developer ecosystem.
