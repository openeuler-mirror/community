# Application to create a new SIG
English | [简体中文](./ai_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README] (/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance] (/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

# SIG Mission
- Build an AI infrastructure framework to provide key capabilities such as unified access of southbound XPUs (such as CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs), heterogeneous converged memory, heterogeneous converged virtualization, computing power segmentation, training resource priority configuration, and elastic migration. Enables full-stack adaptation of AI applications and helps enterprises build AI infrastructure solutions in scenarios such as training and promotion acceleration and hybrid deployment of training and promotion.
