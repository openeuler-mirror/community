mate-desktop

## SIG Mission and Scope

- The MATE desktop environment is a continuation of GNOME2. It provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The MATE desktop has 42 components, of which 21 are core components, such as caja, mate-panel, mate-desktop, mate-session-manager, etc., and its upstream community is active.
- Does not depend on the kernel and can be used in multiple Linux development versions, such as Ubuntu, Debian, LinuxMint, Fedora, etc.
- Xorg-x11-xinit is a package that introduces modifications to openEuler.
- MATE 1.20 has been migrated from GTK2 to GTK3 since MATE 1.20, and integrated some suitable new features in GNOME3. In order to avoid conflicts with GNOME components, MATE has renamed some applications, such as the file manager caja, which is based on A modified version of Nautilus, the eye of the picture viewer MATE, which is a modified version of the eye of GNOME, a MATE terminal, which is a modified version of the GNOME terminal, so far MATE has been compatible with GNOME3 and coexist.
- Mate can coexist with other desktop environments including KDE, GNOME, etc. in openEuler.
- With the update of the version, we will fix some vulnerabilities through the MATE upstream community or Pricewater R & D staff.
- Currently, MATE is actively developing to increase support for new technologies while retaining the traditional desktop experience.
