name: Xen
description: Xen is a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) originally developed by the
  Systems Research Group of the University of Cambridge Computer
  Laboratory, as part of the UK-EPSRC funded XenoServers project.
  It provides powerful virtualization technology that enables multiple virtual
  machines to run in parallel on a physical server, thereby making full use of
  hardware resources and improving system utilization and flexibility.
  It is a type-1 (bare-metal) virtualization platform, which means that
  Xen runs directly on the physical hardware without the need for an
  operating system as an intermediary layer. This architecture enables
  Xen to have lower virtualization overhead, closer to native performance,
  and provide superior performance and reliability.
