# Intel Arch SIG
English | [简体中文](./README_cn.md)

### Mission

- Support enabling Intel new hardware features and platforms on openEuler

- Accelerate the delivery of Intel software vertical stack support and optimize the solution on openEuler.

- Coordinate and help to match the release roadmap of Intel platforms with openEuler.

- Foster innovation and evolution of key areas on openEuler for Intel features in different software layer of kernel, virtualization, toolchain, essential libraries, SDK tools, and userspace applications.

- Feedback openEuler customer's requests for improving Intel hardware and openEuler.

### Scope

- Work with the SIGs or teams of kernel, virtualization, toolchain, essential libs, SDK tools, backport upstream code and enabling innovation projects into openEuler.

- Help bringing more code to upstream.

- Support Intel vertical software stack enabling such as various accelerators, AI, orchestration, security, etc.

- Work with the SIGs of Compatibility and CICD, improve hardware compatibility tests of openEuler on various Intel hardware platforms.

- Work with the Release SIG, set up the goal of Intel hardware support in each openEuler release.

- Facilitate technical information sharing between openEuler community and Intel hardware vendors.

- Respond to user feedback and issues.
