description: etmem, the memory vertical expansion technology, uses DRAM and high-performance
  storage new media to form multi-level memory storage. By grading the stored data,
  etmem migrates the classified cold storage data from memory to the high-performance
  storage medium, so as to achieve the purpose of memory capacity expansion and memory
  cost reduction.
