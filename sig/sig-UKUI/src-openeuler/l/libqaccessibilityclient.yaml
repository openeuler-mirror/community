description: This library is used when writing accessibility clients such as screen
  readers. It comes with some examples demonstrating the API. These small helpers
  may be useful when testing accessibility. One of them writes all accessibiliy interfaces
  an application provides as text output. The other, more advanced application shows
  a tree of objects and allows some interaction and exploration.
