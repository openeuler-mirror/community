description: The Unified Memory Development Kit(UMDK) is a set of distributed communication software stack
  with memory semantics as the core. It aims to design a new-generation network architecture through
  software-hardware collaboration, subvert the traditional communication form, and build a computing
  native network centered on memory semantic interconnection.
