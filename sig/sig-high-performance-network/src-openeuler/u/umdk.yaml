description: The Unified Memory Development Kit(UMDK) is a set of distributed communication
  software stack with memory semantics as the core. It aims to design a new-generation
  network architecture through software-hardware collaboration, subvert the traditional
  communication form, and build a computing native network centered on memory semantic
  interconnection.
