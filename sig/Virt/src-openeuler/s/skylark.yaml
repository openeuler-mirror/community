name: skylark
description: Skylark is a next-generation QoS-aware scheduler which provides coordinated
  resource scheduling for co-located applications with different QoS requirements.
  Typical applications are VM and Container. The architecture is highly scalable,
  so it's easy to be extended to support new types of applications and resources in
  the future.
