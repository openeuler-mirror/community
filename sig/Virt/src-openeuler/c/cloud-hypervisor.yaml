description: Cloud Hypervisor is an open source Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) that runs on top of KVM.
  The project focuses on exclusively running modern, cloud workloads, on top of a limited set of hardware architectures and platforms.
  Cloud workloads refers to those that are usually run by customers inside a cloud provider.
  For our purposes this means modern Linux* distributions with most I/O handled by paravirtualised devices (i.e. virtio),
  no requirement for legacy devices and recent CPUs and KVM.
