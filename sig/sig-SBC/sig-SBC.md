# openEuler SBC Special Interest Group (SIG)

English | [简体中文](./sig-SBC_cn.md)

The SBC SIG aims at migrating openEuler to various single-board computers, in order to reduce the threshold for using openEuler and promote openEuler to new users.

## Mission

- Adapting openEuler to run on various types of single-board computers, including RaspberryPi, Rockchip, and other SBCs.
- Maintaining the construction of internal test images, including kernel source code and image building reference scripts for basic adaptation.
- Managing the list of supported SBC devices capable of running openEuler and their adaptation status.
- Advocating for the improvement and integration of stable kernel patches that meet the requirements of the kernel group into the community mainline kernel code.
- Promoting images that comply with community release requirements to become officially released images in the community.

## Meeting

- Meeting Time: The 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month, 17:00 - 17:30 UTC+8.
- Meeting Link: There are two methods to get the meeting link which will be updated before each meeting.
  - Log in to the [openEuler Community](https://openeuler.org/) website, then view the booking information in the meeting calendar.
  - Search `openEuler` in mini programs of Wechat, add `openEuler mini program`. Then click `会议` and view the booking information.
