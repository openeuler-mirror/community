description: "cups-filters provides filters (to convert data formats for printing) and backends (to communicate with printer hardware) for use with CUPS under non-Mac operating systems. The project originates in Apple (owner of CUPS that time) outsourcing the filters which were not used by Mac OS to OpenPrinting back in 2011."
