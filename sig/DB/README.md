# DB SIG
English | [简体中文](./README.CN.md)

*DB SIG as a working group to introduce the whole database ecosystem into openEuler community.*<br>
*\*Notes\*: As DB SIG will work with the global contributors, so we suggest all development progress or issue description
should be in english version.*

## The major goal and working scope of DB SIG
- Be responsibility for maintaining the database open-source software packages in openEuler, including Mysql, MariaDB,
PostgreSQL and openGauss.
- Introducing more OLTP database into openEuler, such as openGauss or any other popular open-source databases into
openEuler community.
- Introducing the ecosystem tools around databases to enrich and complete the entire DB product software ecosystem.

## Scopes and Rules of DB SIG packages

### Scopes of DB SIG packages
Currently, DB SIG is in the initial stage, and the maintenance ability of team members is limited. At present, in order
to meet the main goals of DB SIG, we keep a higher priority to support the mainstream open-source databases, including
complementing the mainstream versions of the related open-source database software in the industry.
**In the early of DB SIG, we keep a higher priority to  accept new packages or existing packages which are match
our current goal into DB SIG for maintaining.**

For the new packages contribution process steps should be as showed below:

1. Contributors need to post a PR for your new package proposal in [openEuler/community](https://gitee.com/openeuler/community).
2. And @at the [Maintainers](https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/tree/master/sig/DB#maintainers) of DB SIG to review the new proposal, then decide whether accept the new ones. Also
   contributors can contact with DB SIG maintainers in any other ways, such as wechat, slack or email.
3. Once the said PR gets a `/lgtm` from any Maintainer of DB SIG, the openEuler TC members just need to merge the PR
   directly. 

### Rules and Permission clarification
 - Only Maintainers of DB SIG can decide whether accept new packages or existing packages in openEuler which might be
   related with DB locate into DB SIG.
 - The Committers are the responsibility of the normal maintaining of the projects covered by DB SIG.
