## SIG Mission and Scope

### sig-YuanRong objectives:
- sig-YuanRong is responsible for the evolution and maintenance of the Serverless distributed computing engine within the community.

### sig-UnifiedBus positioning:

- Building a "functionally distributed minimalist programming, efficient distributed operation and scheduling" confrontation can effectively give full play to the advantages of Lingqu hardware, simplify developers' use of Lingqu super node labor, and build a Lingqu developer ecosystem through open source.

- Join hands with the openEuler community to jointly promote the evolution of Serverless distributed computing engine-related technologies and the construction of a full-stack application ecosystem.
