# Application to create a new SIG
English | [简体中文](./bigdata_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README] (/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance] (/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).
 
# SIG Mission
The data has become the fifth factor of production after land, labor, capital and technology. In this case, the OpenEuler community needs to consider how to fully play the role of data in production and life from the technical perspective and build big data processing capabilities. The SIG is responsible for building big data processing capabilities.

# Service scope
- Basic big data running capabilities on OpenEuler, including data collection, data transmission, data storage, data analysis, and data visualization.
- Bigdata platforms integrating various commonly used tools and software to provide a unified user interface, making big data easier to use on OpenEuler.
- Performance optimizing of big data components and platforms on the OpenEuler to make big data better on the OpenEuler.
- Integrating big data-related capabilities on OpenEuler and support new chips and software when they are coming.
