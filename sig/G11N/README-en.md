## SIG Introduction

This is the repository for the openEuler globalization (G11N) SIG.

The SIG aims to accelerate the globalization of openEuler and make openEuler ubiquitously accessible to people of all language backgrounds. It provides a platform for people who are devoted to the globalization of openEuler community and those who need professional language assistance.

The SIG will take responsibilities for the Internationalization (I18N) and Localization (L10N) of openEuler, which includes:  

- Community globalization  

  The SIG welcomes contributors from all over the world to help translate openEuler to multiple languages. It offers multilingual support, globalization and cultural communication skills, and serves as a localization platform for openEuler.

  1. Multilingual support

     If you are interested in openEuler and want to translate openEuler to your own language, you can join our existing translation teams or start a new team if there is none appointed for your language.

     This SIG will provide the following documents to assist your translation effort:

     - *Translation Team Creation Guide*
     - *Translation Team Creation Checklist*
     - *Translation Team Mailing List*
     - *Upstream Team Cooperation Guide*
     - *Team Communication Strategies*
     - *FAQs*

  2. Globalization and localization support

     To further support translation teams and help openEuler developers lower the barrier for contributions, the SIG will also open several columns regarding:

     - Translation best practices
     - Globalization principles 
     - Cultural taboos 
     - Standard localization processes
     - Tips for website globalization test 
     - Translation and localization skills

- Industry insights 

  The SIG will translate and share open source industry insights, including analyst reports, industry news, and more relevant contents for developers to better construct the community. Members will also write blogs regularly for further discussions about the trending topics of open source communities and OS development.

## SIG Meetings

If you are interested in providing your native language support in expanding openEuler global influence, please check for and join an existing translation team or create a new one. Please follow the *Translation Team Creation Guide* to file an application. New applications will be thoroughly considered before acceptance. 

In addition, feel free to join the SIG meeting and discuss the globalization insights with us. You can find the meeting minutes and all related materials in the *Documentation* folder.

SIG meetings will be held regularly for knowledge sharing and Q&A.

**Meeting Time**: A public routine online discussion meeting is held at 10:00 a.m. on a Friday every month.

**Attendance Method**: Meeting topics and notifications will be finalized three days in advance via the mailing list (g11n@openeuler.org). Please submit your topics by email and ensure your attendance on the scheduled meeting day.
