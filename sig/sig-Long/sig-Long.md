Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

### sig-Long objectives:
- Explore the future development path of OpenEuler by integrating heterogeneous computing power.

### sig-Long positioning:

- Gather developers and enthusiasts to explore related technologies, give full play to the advantages of different hardware devices, maximize the requirements of different application loads, and reduce the development barriers and cost.

- Build a heterogeneous converged computing infrastructure framework to provide key capabilities such as unified access, heterogeneous converged memory, heterogeneous converged virtualization, computing power segmentation, resource priority configuration, and elastic migration. Open source and maintain corresponding software components in the openEuler community.

- Enable applications to use heterogeneous converged computing infrastructure, reduce costs and improve efficiency, and gradually improve the future software ecosystem based on OpenEuler.
