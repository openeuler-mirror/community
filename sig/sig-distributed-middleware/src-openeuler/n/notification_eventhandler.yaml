description: EventHandler provides the basic ability for OpenHarmony thread to thread
  communication, allowing for the creation of new threads through EventRunner and
  the throwing of time-consuming operations onto the new thread for execution, thereby
  achieving reasonable processing of time-consuming tasks without blocking the original
  thread.
