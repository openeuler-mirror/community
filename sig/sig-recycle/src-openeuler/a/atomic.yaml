description: The goal of Atomic is to provide a high level, coherent entrypoint to
  the system, and fill in gaps. atomic can make it easier to interact with container
  runtimes for different kinds of containers, such as super-privileged and system
  containers. The atomic host subcommand wraps rpm-ostree providing unified management.
