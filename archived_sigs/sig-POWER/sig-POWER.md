English | [简体中文](./sig-template_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission 

At present, openeuler has completed the support of X86, arm, SW, looarch, MIPs and other CPU architectures, and established sig-power to make up for the gap in the community's support of open source reduced instruction set power architectur
Assist in solving the problems encountered in the integration of power products and Euler system, and promote the industrialization and marketization of openeuler power.

## Service scope

-Committed to the adaptation of openeuler system on domestic power architecture

-Build the maintenance capability of open source software that power architecture and downstream products rely on in openeuler to ensure the supply security of upstream open source software and the future self maintenance evolution.

-Cooperate with the open source reduced instruction set power architecture + openeuler community to jointly commit to the prosperity of domestic developer ecology.

-Be responsible for the planning, migration and tuning of relevant software packages under the power architecture, and output the corresponding migration and tuning documents

-Timely respond to user feedback and solve relevant problems

-Management of all relevant documents, meetings, mailing lists and IRC of power sig group
